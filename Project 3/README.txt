PROJECT 3


Overview:
Created an accumulator-based simulator for a multi-cycle machine that can process ten instructions...
ADDI, B, BEQZ, BGE, BNE, LA, LB, LI, SUBI, and SYSCALL.
The machine is also now supposed to be pieplined with interlocks and forwarding.
ALL PROGRAMS WERE CREATED AND COMPILED IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE


How to run Simulator:
In a linux terminal type the following commands in order... 
g++ pipeSim.cpp -o pipeSim -std=c++11
./pipeSim


Results for lab3c.s:
Total clock cycles- 12
Total Instructions executed- 16 
Number of NOPs- 5


Issues:
Unfortunately, I could never successfully get this program to work. I attempted to implement all stages of
the pipeline, but that continually failed. Although my final product does not work correctly, I hope my effort 
can be appreciated.
