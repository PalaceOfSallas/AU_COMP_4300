PROJECT 2


Overview:
Created an accumulator-based simulator for a multi-cycle machine that can process ten instructions...
ADDI, B, BEQZ, BGE, BNE, LA, LB, LI, SUBI, and SYSCALL.
The machine asks for a word and evaluates whether or not it is a palindrome.
It also tells you the number of instructions executed, number of cycles spent in execution, and speed-up.
ALL PROGRAMS WERE CREATED AND COMPILED IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE


How to run Simulator:
In a linux terminal type the following commands in order... 
g++ gprSim.cpp -o gprSim -std=c++11
./gprSim
Results for IC, C, and speed-up will be found in file - "result.txt"


Issues:
No real issues creating this machine. Struggled a little implementing SYSCALL, but eventually figured it out
after researching the way a real MIPS machine uses the instruction.
